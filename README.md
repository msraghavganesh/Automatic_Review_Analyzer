# Automatic_Review_Analyzer
The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale.This Project Is part of Massachusetts Institute of Technology MITx 6.86x.

The Challenging Tasks are as follows:
1) Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

2) Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

3) Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.


Across Global Projects at ExxonMobil, knowledge is often transferred informally and relies heavily on individual memory. When technical questions arise, leaders recall past experiences and connect people manually, which becomes inefficient—especially with structured role rotations every three years. Critical insights, one-off solutions, lessons learned, and handover knowledge are frequently lost or recreated from scratch.
This proposal introduces an AI-enabled Knowledge & Continuity Platform that captures day-to-day problem-solving, non-standard cases, decision rationales, and handover insights in a structured format. The system clusters content by roles, disciplines, and topics, enabling smart retrieval of similar past solutions and subject matter experts. A complementary “ExxonMobil TV” channel allows teams to upload short learning videos, preserving tacit knowledge.
The result is a living institutional memory that reduces dependency on individuals, accelerates onboarding, prevents repetitive work, and enables cross-functional innovation—shifting our culture from rediscovery to cumulative value creation.
