# Automatic_Review_Analyzer
The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale.This Project Is part of Massachusetts Institute of Technology MITx 6.86x.

The Challenging Tasks are as follows:
1) Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

2) Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

3) Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.


Across Global Projects at ExxonMobil, knowledge is often transferred informally and relies heavily on individual memory. When technical questions arise, leaders recall past experiences and connect people manually, which becomes inefficient—especially with structured role rotations every three years. Critical insights, one-off solutions, lessons learned, and handover knowledge are frequently lost or recreated from scratch.
This proposal introduces an AI-enabled Knowledge & Continuity Platform that captures day-to-day problem-solving, non-standard cases, decision rationales, and handover insights in a structured format. The system clusters content by roles, disciplines, and topics, enabling smart retrieval of similar past solutions and subject matter experts. A complementary “ExxonMobil TV” channel allows teams to upload short learning videos, preserving tacit knowledge.
The result is a living institutional memory that reduces dependency on individuals, accelerates onboarding, prevents repetitive work, and enables cross-functional innovation—shifting our culture from rediscovery to cumulative value creation.


The primary customers of this solution are employees within Global Projects at ExxonMobil, particularly engineers, project managers, discipline leads, and rotating role holders. Secondary customers include new joiners, early-career professionals, and cross-functional teams seeking expertise outside their immediate network.
Leads and subject matter experts will interact with the platform by documenting non-standard cases, lessons learned, technical decisions, and handover insights in a structured format. Employees facing technical challenges will use the AI-enabled search engine to retrieve similar past solutions, identify relevant experts, and access contextual documentation or learning videos. During role rotations, outgoing and incoming employees will leverage the living handover thread to review cumulative guidance rather than restarting documentation from scratch.
At an organizational level, leadership and project excellence teams can analyze clustered data to identify recurring inefficiencies, innovation opportunities, and cross-project patterns. Ultimately, this platform impacts knowledge continuity, onboarding efficiency, collaboration, and innovation across the Global Projects organization, creating a scalable institutional memory framework

Key Requirements & Implementation Plan
To successfully implement this initiative within ExxonMobil, a structured 1–2 year phased roadmap with dedicated resources is required.
1️⃣ Budget Estimate
Requested Investment: $150,000–$200,000 USD
This budget will primarily support:
Dedicated IT development resources
AI configuration and clustering capability
Platform integration with existing systems (e.g., SharePoint, Teams, EEMTV)
Pilot program execution and change management
Governance framework and content standardization
This is a modest investment relative to potential productivity gains across Global Projects.
2️⃣ Core Resources Required
🔹 People
1 Product Owner (Global Projects)
1 Project Manager (part-time)
2 IT/Digital platform developers
1 AI/Analytics specialist
3–5 SME advisors (rotational)
Change management support
🔹 Technical
Integration with EEMTV (existing internal video ecosystem)
SharePoint/Teams-based documentation backbone
AI layer for tagging, clustering, and smart retrieval
Secure data governance and access control framework
3️⃣ Phased Timeline (1–2 Years)
Phase 1 (0–6 Months) – Foundation
Define taxonomy & tagging structure
Build documentation templates
Pilot structured knowledge repository
Integrate EEMTV channels
Limited AI search functionality
Phase 2 (6–12 Months) – Intelligence Layer
Deploy AI clustering
Enable smart recommendations
Build SME mapping capability
Expand pilot to multiple project groups
Phase 3 (12–24 Months) – Enterprise Scaling
Global Projects-wide rollout
Analytics dashboards for leadership
Pattern recognition for recurring inefficiencies
Innovation matchmaking capability
4️⃣ Resource Commitment
Concept framing and pilot validation can begin within my current role.
However, scalable development requires dedicated digital resources.
No major external vendor support is required if internal platforms are leveraged, though targeted AI advisory support may accelerate advanced features.
Winning Mindset Positioning
This is not a documentation tool.
It is an Institutional Memory Engine.
For <$200K, we move from:
Memory-based operations
to
AI-enabled cumulative intelligence.
That’s strategic, scalable, and future-proof.


why timeline

We selected a 1–2 year implementation horizon because this initiative represents both a technical deployment and a cultural transformation within ExxonMobil. While enabling technologies exist, the true effort lies in defining governance standards, building AI-enabled clustering, integrating platforms such as EEMTV, and piloting across Global Projects. More importantly, this shifts how teams “get work done”—from memory-driven knowledge sharing to structured institutional intelligence. Adoption, training, leadership alignment, and behavioral change require phased rollout and validation, making a deliberate 1–2 year timeline both realistic and strategically responsible

Within ExxonMobil, knowledge today exists in multiple forms: formal lessons-learned databases, LLM-powered chatbots trained on project archives, team-specific OneNote files, SharePoint folders, email chains, and informal Zoom/Teams discussions. Each serves a purpose—but all are fragmented, siloed, or retrospective. They either store information after a project concludes or depend on individuals to know where to look.
This concept is fundamentally different.
It does not aim to improve documentation or enhance search. It creates a living execution intelligence layer across Global Projects. Instead of archiving past events, it continuously captures how work actually gets done—decisions, trade-offs, workarounds, and problem-solving patterns—in structured, AI-connected threads aligned to roles and disciplines. Video-enabled micro-knowledge replaces long reports. Expertise becomes discoverable without knowing who to ask.
Rather than another repository or chatbot, this is an operational memory network—connecting people, problems, and patterns in real time. It transforms isolated knowledge assets into a dynamic, cross-project intelligence engine.
