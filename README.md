# Automatic_Review_Analyzer
The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale.This Project Is part of Massachusetts Institute of Technology MITx 6.86x.

The Challenging Tasks are as follows:
1) Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

2) Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

3) Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.


Across Global Projects at ExxonMobil, knowledge is often transferred informally and relies heavily on individual memory. When technical questions arise, leaders recall past experiences and connect people manually, which becomes inefficient—especially with structured role rotations every three years. Critical insights, one-off solutions, lessons learned, and handover knowledge are frequently lost or recreated from scratch.
This proposal introduces an AI-enabled Knowledge & Continuity Platform that captures day-to-day problem-solving, non-standard cases, decision rationales, and handover insights in a structured format. The system clusters content by roles, disciplines, and topics, enabling smart retrieval of similar past solutions and subject matter experts. A complementary “ExxonMobil TV” channel allows teams to upload short learning videos, preserving tacit knowledge.
The result is a living institutional memory that reduces dependency on individuals, accelerates onboarding, prevents repetitive work, and enables cross-functional innovation—shifting our culture from rediscovery to cumulative value creation.


The primary customers of this solution are employees within Global Projects at ExxonMobil, particularly engineers, project managers, discipline leads, and rotating role holders. Secondary customers include new joiners, early-career professionals, and cross-functional teams seeking expertise outside their immediate network.
Leads and subject matter experts will interact with the platform by documenting non-standard cases, lessons learned, technical decisions, and handover insights in a structured format. Employees facing technical challenges will use the AI-enabled search engine to retrieve similar past solutions, identify relevant experts, and access contextual documentation or learning videos. During role rotations, outgoing and incoming employees will leverage the living handover thread to review cumulative guidance rather than restarting documentation from scratch.
At an organizational level, leadership and project excellence teams can analyze clustered data to identify recurring inefficiencies, innovation opportunities, and cross-project patterns. Ultimately, this platform impacts knowledge continuity, onboarding efficiency, collaboration, and innovation across the Global Projects organization, creating a scalable institutional memory framework
